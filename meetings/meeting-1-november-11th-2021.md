## 2) Introduction** to the Circle**

### **General introduction (Victor, 12:13)**

* You are here representing your own groups, but not defending against other groups. It’s collaborative.
* Don’t have to do everything by yourself. You’re here to lead, coordinate, and inspire your groups, and to build bridges.
* It's a big responsibility, but it's also an experiment. As in Catalyst overall, things may break. Don't be afraid of changing things.

### **Problem-sensing best practices (18:13)**

* Telegram
* Miro boards
* Using voting to rank problems
* Live sessions and interactivity
* After Town Hall and Swarm sessions
* CCv2 can use the problem-sensing backlog created by CCv1; but they do not have to.
* Use and talk to your community
* If you feel you don’t know how to facilitate a problem sensing session, you can learn from the rest of the Circle. This is a safe space to be real about what you feel comfortable & confident about.

### **Process explanation  (38:16)**

* There is a new CC Slack: will be primary communication tool for CCv2, Admin team, and CCv1 alumni, to plan agendas, discuss Fund 7 proposals, and all out-of-meeting communications.
* Slack integrations are available – not free, but there is budget if it’s desired
* Currently using Trello for task tracking, tho this can change if people want.
* \[Action Item - Michael Yagi] Task tracking tool
* GitBook documentation of meetings will continue to be done by QA-DAO
* Website \[WIP] for high level learning about Catalyst Circle and links to public documentation; some of the GitBook info might also be there
* Catalyst Circle email addresses will be set up.
  * Instead of name, use role; transferable
* Michael is setting up Confluence for Admin team documentation. They also use Jira (40:45)
* Tevo might use Miroboards to e.g. share results from problem-sensing, but not to document CC meetings
* <mark style="color:red;">\[Action Item] Retire Telegram - Add Daniel Ribar to Slack</mark>
* **Prototyping  (Dor, 49:22)** Catalyst is a prototype of Voltaire governance. Look for the best tools and techniques, experiment with them in Circle, and if they work, they could become part of Cardano’s canon of governance methodologies.
* **Accessibility (Stephen, 52:03)** – Good to experiment with tools – but need to make it accessible. Sometimes proprietary tools are inaccessible.
* **Processes  and tools for communicating the work of Circle:** (52:53)
  * SPOCRA uses public meetings
  * one-to-one discussions with key people
  * CAs use Telegram, and find it better than Discord
  * reaching General Voters is harder; Voter Surveys (incentivised and non-incentivised) might help.
    * <mark style="color:red;">Action item: share feedback and analysis from voter surveys from funds 1-5 at a future CC meeting.</mark>

### **3) Trello board handover (1:01:02) **[_Trello_](https://trello.com/b/DRBO6qyF/catalyst-prioritized-problems)[_ _](https://trello.com/b/DRBO6qyF/catalyst-prioritized-problems)[_Board_](https://trello.com/b/DRBO6qyF/catalyst-prioritized-problems)

**Explanation of columns and structure of Trello board** **(Dor, 1:02:43**)

Th_e_ columns are:

* problem backlog
* raw problems (NB tickets need an owner)
* well defined problems
* Shared with Community
* Picked Up (Circle can take direct ownership, or community members can. There can be more than one group working on a problem).
*   Protoyping  (when an actual prototype of a solution is produced by those working on it). From here, it can move to either

    * “validation”, if the prototype solution is successful; and then “integrated”, when the solution becomes fully integrated into the Catalyst process
    * “rejected”,  if the prototype solution is unsuccessful


* **Discussion of approaches to Trello **
  * Can we split tasks into subtasks? **(Tevo 1:11:27)**
  * Some problems might be too specific, others too broad – CCv2 might want to discuss this during their problem-sensing (**Victor 1:14:06) **
  * Jira might be a better tool than Trello – but if we move to Jira, need a project manager. Decision: Split the Secretary role into Secretary and PM
  * Tools we use need to be public facing (**Harris  1:17:19) **
  * We should move to open-source tools, not proprietary (**Stephen 1:18:02)**
  * <mark style="color:red;">Decision: discuss in a future meeting moving to public-facing and open-source tools</mark>
  * Trello cards should be moved within meetings only
  * CCv2 should make a fresh start at defining problems – but if a problem identified by CCv1 still resonates, keep it on the board if you want to **Dor  1:20:31 **
  * Mentors can help give background info on existing cards **Juliane 1:23:06**
  * Decision – review the board in CCv2’s next meting and decide which cards to keep
  * Perhaps named owners of Trello cards should be the role, not the name of the individual? Undecided – person’s name might be useful for emphasis
  * More than one name can “own” a card
  * CCv1 members who are still engaged with a problem can continue to be involved; they should liaise with their CCv2 counterpart
  * Action item: Admin team to invite CCv2 to the Trello board
