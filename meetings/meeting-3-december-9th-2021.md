## 2) Circle members' work

The "CC Stand-Up" - each person says

* what they have worked on since last meeting
* what they will be working on next
* any blocks, or anything they need help with.

**Allison (9:14)**

* Proposals submission, particularly for a Voter Survey; creating a roadmap to how to create a legal entity; and working with Kenric on an [Atala PRISM](https://atalaprism.io/app) DIDs project for CAs
* Office Hours – more advance notice and more time zones; working on survey data; preparing for next CC election.
* Blocks: need email address for General ADA Voters role; website; other infrastructure. CC Admin team are fixing this; QA-DAO GitBook also functions as a CC landing page.

**Stephen (16:56)**

* Created list of proposals to be considered for CC sponsorship [https://github.com/Catalyst-Circle/Catalyst-Circle-Coordination/issues/1](https://github.com/Catalyst-Circle/Catalyst-Circle-Coordination/issues/1); wrote and submitted governance-related proposals with [Dor Garbash](https://iohk.io/en/team/dor-garbash) and QA-DAO&#x20;

* Gathering feedback from Funded Cohort [https://github.com/Catalyst-Coordinator/Feedback/issues](https://github.com/Catalyst-Coordinator/Feedback/issues)
* No blocks.

**Matthias (19:38)**

* Met with [Frederik Gregaard](https://cardanofoundation.org/en/news/cardano-foundation-appoints-frederik-gregaard-as-ceo-and-strengthens-its-executive-leadership/), CEO of Cardano Foundation; ATH with Ambassadors’ Guild; Fund 8 challenge submissions on Open-Source Developer Ecosystem and  general Developer Ecosystem; decided to set the challenge budget for the Open-Source version higher ($2M) than the general ($1M) to reflect the commitment to open-source.
* Working with Ambassadors’ Guild to redefine ambassadorship; continue dialogue with Catalyst community.
* No blocks.

**Tevo (22:58)**

* Berlin trip with several ex-CC members, lots of useful conversations. Proposal submissions; proposal workshops, and supporting others to complete their proposals.
* Continued proposal and CA education and support.
* Block – not sure how to leverage Admin team support when needed; and process is not clear  for progressing problem-sensing or “tool sensing” (identifying the tools that the Catalyst community uses).

**Kenric (27:17)**

* [Atala PRISM Pioneers](https://atalaprism.io/pioneers/) course, and developing DIDs for CAs with Allison; hosted a CAs’ Q\&A session at ATH
* Similar Q\&A for VCAs next week; CA feedback meeting in 2 or 3 weeks
* No blocks.

**Harris (30:20)**

* Working on [Voltaire roadmap](https://roadmap.cardano.org/en/voltaire/) and mechanisms; contributed to proposal writing on this but I could have done more; worked on governance APIs and governance SDK that will help teams both inside and outside IO to build tools e.g. for voting mechanisms
* Want to discuss the governance parameters pilot in this meeting; would have been better if this meeting had been before proposal deadline so CC could have agreed proposals before they went in; also want to share more on the data from feedback; and support the definition of Catalyst Technical Council
* No blocks.

**Raymond (35:18)**

* About a week behind due to family issues; many SPOs missed deadlines for proposals. Problem-sensing: some SPOs see the funding process as a popularity contest they cannot win. [Twitter Spaces](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/spaces) have been effective to raise awareness of CC in the SPO community.
* Developing Office Hours, and holding Twitter Spaces regularly
* No blocks.
