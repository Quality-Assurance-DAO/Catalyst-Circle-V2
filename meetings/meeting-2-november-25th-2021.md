## **1) Opening and Agenda (0:02)**

* Opening check-in 0:02
* Announcements (none) 4:51
* Agenda 5:17

## **2) Circle members' work (7:56)**

Each person says:

* what they have worked on since last meeting
* what they will be working on next
* any blocks, or anything they need help with.

**Matthias (9:11)**

* Got problem statement from CF  in answer to Town Hall last week. Conversations with Head of Partnerships, Jeremy, and with Ambassadors’ Guild.
* Meeting with Frederick (head of CF) Mon 29th Nov
* Invites input on Distributed Governance Fund 8 challenge setting and Cloud Credits fund 7 proposal.

**Allison (10:50)**

* Discussions on Twitter about process of electing CC. Also connected with Tony Rose re getting Prism pioneers more involved in Catalyst.
* Planning to hold Office Hours, to be more contactable/accountable; and exploring how to track issues raised and make them actionable.
* Would like ideas on better organisational structures, and support on building a core team of general voters. Also raised issue of legalities around IOG sponsoring lobbyists in a non-US country – something to check on.

**Stephen (15:56)**

* Set up Catalyst Coordinator GitBook for problem-sensing the Funded Cohort process; announced and shared contact info at Town Hall. Began a GitBook for Challenge Teams, by popular demand, to aggregate all the challenge settings. Submitted several draft proposals, and “Improve and Grow Auditability” Fund 8 challenge setting.
* Refining proposals; refining Coordinator problem-sensing; continuing work on Challenge Team aggregation; meeting with Gimbalabs on Jan 11th about “almost non-existing collaborative layer” problem currently on CC Trello board.
* Planning to hand over some of my Fund 6 work, to allow me to work more on Circle.

**Megan (17:52)**

* Here representing Kenric. He has been working on a Fund 7 proposal around governance
* No specific info from him on future work
* Blocks – he has been very busy, which should improve after the weekend.

**Harris (18:53)**

* Been working on roadmap – the next 6 to 12 months of work to transition from IOG as the custodian of Catalyst, to handing over to the community; planning pilots to enable this.
* Want to process feedback from the community; and hand the processing over more to the community.
* No blockers.

**Raymond (21:00)**

* Problem-sensing about how SPOs perceive Catalyst; building awareness and discussion of fund 7 proposals related to SPO issues.
* Getting SPOs involved in the CA process, educating SPOs about becoming a CA
* Have been busy and travelling.

**Tevo (24:38)**

* Mini-proposal workshops; workshops in Sustainability event, and in Eastern Town Hall on introducing people to Catalyst; private session with [WADA](https://wadalliance.org); meeting with [TalTech University](https://taltech.ee/en)
* Follow-up with TalTech Uni
* Question on who, and how many people, I should get confirmation from before taking an action.

## **3) Consent Agenda (28:21)**

### **Harris Warren: presentation on Catalyst Parameters governance process (29:22)**

* **29:22** IOG wants to decentralise governance so people outside of IOG are involved in setting parameters related to Catalyst _\[e.g. how funds are spent; dates; voting power thresholds, voter / CA rewards, etc_].
* **30:22** Propose to start with a pilot. CC would have decision-making powers; and a new additional governing body, Catalyst Expert Council would be created.
* **31:38** How parameters have been set until now
* **33:13** Desired state is to open up parameter-setting to CC, with the proposed new Catalyst Expert Council co-defining the parameters. Iterate through each Fund, with people voted in to drive decision-making.
* **34:08** This is about Catalyst-specific parameters only, not other things.
*   **35:15** Catalyst Expert Council would be able to decide or veto decisions.It would consist initially of people appointed by IOG:

    * [Dor Garbash](https://iohk.io/en/team/dor-garbash)
    * [Kevin Hammond](https://iohk.io/en/team/kevin-hammond)
    * [Roman  Oliynkov](https://iohk.io/en/team/roman-oliynykov)

    and later, its members would be elected.&#x20;
* Aim is a [bicameral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicameralism) system of governance: two bodies, supported by different processes.
* Catalyst Expert Council would not meet on a regular basis; so CC admins and facilitators could support it in addition to CC
* **38:02** Swim lane diagram/flowchart of the proposed governance process: how CC and the new Catalyst Expert Council would process feedback generated from IOG Catalyst Team’s feedback surveys, suggest parameter changes if feedback scores on an issue are low, and inform the community.
* Decision on whether to make a change would be by voting – CC and the new Catalyst Expert Council would vote – simple show of hands, or on the blockchain.
* **40:57** Ideally, we want automation of parameter changes; but IOG can start to hand over the decision-making process even before that capability is built.

### Questions

* **Matthias (42.07)** Why not include the community now?  **Harris (43:40)** We do want to transfer decision-making quickly, but we don’t want to disrupt the ecosystem in the process. Best way is to transfer power iteratively. We think the process needs to evolve slowly. Need to define who is an “expert”.
* **Nori (46:05)**  To clarify, this is about Catalyst parameters only – CAs, voting, proposals, funding, etc. It’s not about block size or k-values, etc.
* **Matthias (46:24)** Will the community be able to decide block size or k-values eventually? **Harris: (46:37)** We know the community will want to have influence over that; and we want to find ways to help them.
* **Allison (47:58)** Would you change the name of the new body to make it clear that they’re playing a research and advisory role? And who has the power; if CC and the Expert Council vote differently, how is that resolved? **Harris (50:34)** We’re not attached to the Expert Council name; and we get to define how disagreement would be resolved.
* **Tevo (52:44)** Could this involve changing processes, e.g. timescale of the funding cycle being too long? **Harris (53:43)** We wanted it to be shorter, but it evolved this way because we need to give the community enough time to make decisions. Automation could speed things up. But it is part of the parameters and could be discussed.
* **Raymond (55:22)** I advise against the word “expert”; makes it sound like their voice is more important than all the others. Is it hierarchical – will the Expert Council ultimately have the say? I think Harris said that is still to be determined? **Harris (56:39)** Yes, we get to experiment.
* **Stephen (56:58)**  On “expertise” – the concept of domain expertise is useful. CC and the Expert Council are both experts in their own domains – so what outputs do they produce? Academic publications from Expert Council? CC publishing or problem sensing in our field of  community expertise? **Harris (58:16)**  Research is helpful and it’s good to consider outputs.

### **Harris Warren – presentation on proposals to support the above (59:11)**

* (59:11) Dor  and I drafted “stub” proposals based on this new suggested governance process. These proposals are:
  *
    * Supporting the new Catalyst Council, with additional scope
    * Introducing a second new body, called “Cardano Governance, Oversight and Improvements”, to provide oversight of CC and Catalyst Expert Council
    * A community-funded information hub
  * The details can be tabled for future discussion.
  * Basically the proposals are trying to ensure
  *
    * no chance of adversarial capture
    * mechanisms to enforce accountability
    * systems that are understandable and easy to use
    * that we have the right people, data, methodologies, roles and policies
    * for it not to become bureaucratic.
  * The “Cardano Governance, Oversight and Improvements” body would monitor that CC and Catalyst Expert Council are maintaining governance values; publish results and assessments to the general public; facilitate retrospectives and track whether improvement actions have been taken.
  * I am over time, so let’s not have feedback; but I will take questions.
