Statement:

> _I am committed to growing the strength, diversity, resilience, and capabilities of the Cardano Catalyst Community. I see Catalyst as uniquely positioned to facilitate the development of liberal democracy throughout the world. Upon initially exploring the cryptocurrency space in 2017, Cardano synchronized with my values regarding the importance of peer-reviewed scientific research; robust engineering development including the use of formal methods to validate functionality; and a commitment to building and supporting diverse communities._
>
> _I founded Photrek with a global focus, hence the choice of "world" for the domain name, and a desire to apply my expertise in simplifying the design of complex decision systems to challenging global problems. Within the Cardano community, Photrek has run the ADAStars ITN stakepool, executed the Fund 4 Diversify Voting Influence project, participated actively in the Catalyst Swarm discussions, acted as a Community Advisor, and veteran Community Advisor. Going forward, Photrek has plans to prototype a Diversified Voting method, develop auditing capabilities for the stakepool cybersecurity, collaborate with Singularity.Net on the development of machine learning methods for blockchain, improve the functioning of Automatic Maker Making exchanges, and much more._
>
> _My career as an Engineer, Scientist, Educator, and Leader has spanned the domain of Electrical and Computer Engineering and has included both industry program management at Raytheon and academic research and teaching at Boston University and Chelsea High School, respectively. Details of my experience are described at_[ _https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenric-nelson-ph-d-7495b77/_](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kenric-nelson-ph-d-7495b77/)_. I'm particularly fascinated with complex nonlinear systems govern the how mankind can effectively utilize machines to improve life on the planet._
>
> _As a Catalyst Circle member guiding the Community Advisors, I would strive to contribute two principal things to the leadership. First, would be a plan to strengthen the recruitment, training, mentorship, and assessment of Community Advisors. I'd like to see the CA program develop the rigor of academic standards and the lean practicality of commercial execution. Secondly, I'd like to contribute the experience and expertise I've developed in human and machine decision systems to the design of Catalyst processes which can assure the fulfillment of the communities aspirations for world-class distributed decision making._

### <mark style="background-color:green;">Allison Fromm - statement</mark>

> _From the moment I stumbled into the whiteboard video Charles had created to explain Cardano, I have been actively looking for ways to utilize my particular skills in the service of the community. <mark style="background-color:green;"></mark> After watching that video in the spring of 2020, I learned all I could about staking, created a non-technical presentation to assist ordinary ADA-holders with the process, and witnessed in real-time the creation of the first Shelley block._
>
> _Through networking with the Cardano Foundation, I had the privilege to meet Dor in the summer of 2020. I joined a tiny handful of volunteers who participated in the original Catalyst Focus Group, and proudly cast my votes in Fund 0._
>
> _I was heartbroken when complications with my immigration status and work permit prevented me from performing a more public role in the subsequent funds, but I avidly watched the development of Catalyst, and of the Cardano ecosystem, from the sidelines._
>
> _Because I was determined to participate on a deeper level, I found a creative solution to my permit issue. With my newfound freedom, I have served as CA, volunteered for a Challenge Team, participated in the proposal submission process for the Rapid Funding Challenge, and joined many discussions on social media about the governance process. I have, of course, continued to cast my own votes._
>
> _I would welcome the opportunity to represent the General ADA Voters. While I don’t have a software engineering background, I have the capability to understand some of the concepts underpinning blockchain technology and the ability to communicate those concepts to diverse audiences. Good governance requires the active involvement of the average ADA holder who, like me, may not necessarily understand the code or the deeper architecture. I would look forward to representing this population, and to bringing their concerns and questions to the Catalyst Circle. I would be honored to continue the work of promoting and fostering engagement from the global community of voters._

### Eli Selkin - statement

> _Eli brings an interesting perspective to the group in that he combines his software engineering skills (he has a MS in Computer Science with a focus on Machine Learning), and management skills (CTO) with and his social work (he is a licensed clinical social worker) and psychology background. Eli is a thoughtful human, Plutus Pioneer, Gimbalabs PPBL Team Member, winner of the Plutus Capstone, and all around good human being with a huge motivation to give. I have worked with Eli in the past on a project that brings people that face housing insecurities in suitable shared housing. Currently, I'm working with him on Fund6's Win-Win Dispute Resolution and auxiliary projects. As someone who has not been invested into Cardano since 2017 - but later - he also brings a fresh perspective to Catalyst and the Cardano Ecosystem overall. Eli has my full support as a representative of the general voters._

### Aldion Ka - statement

> _Aldion is a Swiss knife of Catalyst, lurking around since fund 2. Devoted to peaceful, honest trade and communication. Successful CA role since fund 5. Fund 6 vCA role accomplished. Eager to actively engage in problem sensing and develop and implement new creative strategies to improve the Catalyst process and experience for all._
